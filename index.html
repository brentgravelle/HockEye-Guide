                <h2>Important First Step: Team Management Settings</h2>
                <p>Before you start tracking, it's crucial to understand that the features available within GameTracker are controlled by the <strong>Team Management</strong> settings. Your team owner can decide which events to track (e.g., Hits, Blocks, Assists). If you don't see an option for an action, it's likely disabled in the team settings.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: Pre-Game Setup</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps before the puck drops to ensure a smooth tracking experience.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Select Your Game</h3>
                <p>From the main dropdown menu, choose the game you are about to track. Only games that have <strong>not</strong> been finalized will appear here.</p>
                <div class="screenshot-placeholder">

				<div class="tip-box">
					<strong>Already Set Up?</strong> If you select a game and are taken directly to the rink without seeing the popups below, it means the coach has already set the roster and goalie. You can proceed directly to tracking!
				</div>


                <h3>2. Set the Game Roster</h3>
                <p>When you select a game for the first time, a <strong>Roster Setup</strong> screen will appear. You can select primary and affiliate players. Click <strong>"Set Roster"</strong> to confirm.</p>
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> You can add players to the roster mid-game, but you <strong>cannot remove</strong> them. This must be done by the account owner.

                <p>After the roster is set, you must select the starting goalie or "Empty Net". Tracking cannot begin until a goalie is selected.</p>

				 <div class="tip-box">
					<strong>Note on Layouts:</strong> Depending on your device and screen size, the GameTracker display may look slightly different.
					<ul>
						<li>On wider screens, the Events List appears <strong>beside</strong> the rink.</li>
						<li>On tablets or smaller laptops, the Events List may appear <strong>below</strong> the rink.</li>
						<li>Mobile phones use a completely different "Focus Mode" optimized for touchscreens.</li>

                <h2>Part 3: How to Track Events</h2>
                <p>Tracking follows a simple workflow: <strong>Click the Rink ‚Üí Select the Player ‚Üí Select the Action.</strong></p>

                <h3>Tracking Shots, Goals, Misses, and Posts</h3>
                <p>After clicking the rink, select the player who performed the action. Choose a player from your team, or select the red <strong>'Opponent'</strong> button to track any event caused by the other team.</p>

				<p>Next, choose the shot type (<strong>SHOT, GOAL, MISS,</strong> or <strong>POST</strong>). If "Shot Location" is enabled in your team's settings, a <strong>Net Location</strong> popup will then appear. Click on the net where the shot went to record its location.</p>

                </div>

				<h3>Tracking Faceoffs</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Click the dedicated <strong>Faceoff button</strong>.</li>
						<li>Select the player taking the faceoff.</li>
						<li>An overlay with WIN/LOSS buttons will appear over the 5 main faceoff zones.</li>
						<li>Click <strong>WIN</strong> or <strong>LOSS</strong> in the appropriate zone to record the outcome.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>All neutral zone faceoffs should be recorded using the <strong>center ice</strong> WIN/LOSS buttons.</p>
					<div class="tip-box">
						<strong>Automatic Zone Detection:</strong> As your team and the opponent take shots, GameTracker will automatically learn which end is your offensive zone and which is your defensive zone for the period. Faceoff events will then be updated to reflect this (e.g., "OFF FO", "DEF FO").

                <p>When you log a penalty, the <a href="#glossary-game-situation"><strong>Game Situation</strong></a> will automatically change. However, you must manually change it back when the penalty expires.</p>

				<h3>Editing and Deleting Events</h3>
				<p>In the Events List, you can click the <strong>pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è)</strong> to edit a player or game situation, or the <strong>trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è)</strong> to delete an event entirely.</p>
				
				<p>You can also quickly edit certain events by clicking directly on the event row itself:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Clicking any <strong>shot-type event</strong> (Shot, Goal, Miss, Post) will bring up the Net Location editor (if it's being tracked), allowing you to modify the shot's location on the net.</li>
					<li>Clicking a <strong>Faceoff</strong> event will bring up the faceoff overlay, allowing you to change its location or result (Win/Loss).</li>
				</ul>

                <p>Once the game is over, click the <strong>"Finalize"</strong> button in the events table header. This locks the game from further editing and makes it available in Analytics. A coach or owner can un-finalize it if changes are needed later.</p>

                <h2>Part 6: Strategies for Effective Tracking</h2>
                <div class="tip-box">
                  <strong>üí° Pro Tip: Batch Your Events!</strong> During heavy action, remember 2-3 events. At the next whistle, quickly log all of them. Accuracy is more important than real-time speed.
                </div>
				
				<h3>Collaborative Tracking (Team Tracking)</h3>
				<p>It's possible for multiple people to track the same game simultaneously to capture more detail. If you use this method, divide the responsibilities clearly before the game starts.</p>

				<h4>Example Division of Labor:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Tracker 1 (Primary):</strong> Focuses on all shot events (Shots, Goals, Misses, Posts) and Faceoffs.</li>
					<li><strong>Tracker 2 (Secondary):</strong> Focuses on other events like Takeaways, Giveaways, Hits, and Blocks.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="tip-box">
					<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:</strong> Regardless of how you divide the tasks, it is essential that your team logs all <strong>Penalties</strong> accurately. When one person enters a penalty, the game situation (e.g., 5v4 PP) updates for <strong>everyone</strong> tracking the game. This ensures all events are marked with the proper on-ice situation, which is vital for accurate analysis. Remember to also manually reset the game situation when the penalty expires.
				</div>

				<div class="tip-box">
				  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:</strong> If you are tracking with a partner, you <strong>must</strong> ensure you are both tracking your team's offensive and defensive zones on the same side of the ice. Communicate before the game and at the start of each period to confirm which end your team is attacking.
