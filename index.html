                <h2>Important First Step: Team Management Settings</h2>
                <p>Before you start tracking, it's crucial to understand that the features available within GameTracker are controlled by the <strong>Team Management</strong> settings. Your team owner can decide which events to track (e.g., Hits, Blocks, Assists). If you don't see an option for an action, it's likely disabled in the team settings.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: Pre-Game Setup</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps before the puck drops to ensure a smooth tracking experience.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Select Your Game</h3>
                <p>From the main dropdown menu, choose the game you are about to track. Only games that have <strong>not</strong> been finalized will appear here.</p>
                <div class="screenshot-placeholder">

                <h3>2. Set the Game Roster (Mandatory)</h3>
                <p>When you select a game for the first time, a <strong>Roster Setup</strong> screen will appear. You can select primary and affiliate players. Click <strong>"Set Roster"</strong> to confirm.</p>
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> You can add players to the roster mid-game, but you <strong>cannot remove</strong> them. This must be done by the account owner.

                <h3>3. Select the Starting Goalie (Mandatory)</h3>
                <p>After the roster is set, you must select the starting goalie or "Empty Net". Tracking cannot begin until a goalie is selected.</p>

				 <div class="tip-box">
					<strong>Note on Layouts:</strong> Depending on your device and screen size, the GameTracker display may look slightly different.
					<ul>
						<li>On wide desktop screens, the Events List appears <strong>beside</strong> the rink.</li>
						<li>On tablets or smaller laptops, the Events List may appear <strong>below</strong> the rink.</li>
						<li>Mobile phones use a completely different "Focus Mode" optimized for touchscreens.</li>

                <p>Tracking follows a simple workflow: <strong>Click the Rink ‚Üí Select the Player ‚Üí Select the Action.</strong></p>

                <h3>Tracking Shots, Goals, Misses, and Posts</h3>
                <p>After clicking the rink, selecting a player (or the red Opponent button), and choosing the shot type, a <strong>Net Location</strong> popup will appear for SHOTS and GOALS. Click on the net where the shot went to record its location.</p>

				<h3>Tracking Faceoffs</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Click the dedicated <strong>Faceoff button</strong>.</li>
						<li>Select the player taking the faceoff.</li>
						<li>An overlay with WIN/LOSS buttons will appear over the 5 main faceoff zones.</li>
						<li>Click <strong>WIN</strong> or <strong>LOSS</strong> in the appropriate zone to record the outcome.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>All neutral zone faceoffs should be recorded using the <strong>center ice</strong> WIN/LOSS buttons.</p>
					<div class="tip-box">
						<strong>Automatic Zone Detection:</strong> As your team and the opponent take shots, GameTracker will automatically learn which end is your offensive zone and which is your defensive zone for the period. Faceoff events will then be updated to reflect this (e.g., "OFF FO", "DEF FO").

                <h2>Part 6: Strategies for Effective Tracking</h2>
                <div class="tip-box">
                  <strong>üí° Pro Tip: Batch Your Events!</strong> During heavy action, remember 2-3 events. At the next whistle, quickly log all of them. Accuracy is more important than real-time speed.
                </div>
				
				<h3>Collaborative Tracking (Team Tracking)</h3>
				<p>It's possible for multiple people to track the same game simultaneously to capture more detail. If you use this method, divide the responsibilities clearly before the game starts.</p>
				<p><strong>Example Division of Labor:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Tracker 1 (Primary):</strong> Focuses solely on all shot events (Shots, Goals, Misses, Posts) and all <strong>Penalties</strong>. Tracking penalties is crucial for this role to maintain the correct Power Play (PP) and Penalty Kill (PK) game situation for everyone.</li>
					<li><strong>Tracker 2 (Secondary):</strong> Focuses on other events like Takeaways, Giveaways, Hits, and Blocks.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="tip-box">
				  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:</strong> If you are tracking with a partner, you <strong>must</strong> ensure you are both tracking your team's offensive and defensive zones on the same side of the ice. Communicate before the game and at the start of each period to confirm which end your team is attacking.
